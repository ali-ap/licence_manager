this source code is only a test project for a software developer position

## Installation

Using Manual build requires a consul connection for services to function. 

Since the service is docker enabled and  contains service discovery and api gateway use docker-compose.

```bash
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```
for rebuild images in case of changes
```bash
docker-compose --build
```
## Usage

The whole source code is very simple and self-explanatory.
